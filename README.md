Hi, I'm @AmberLynnR33, or Amber for short!

I love coding and writing, and this is the home to projects I completed in high school and university (with instructor permission), and on my free time.

Currently my favourite coding language is Java, but I also know Python 3.x and am learning Javascript and C!

Hobbies:

- Working on my website (see my pinned repos!)
- Crocheting
- Writing
- Emboidery
- Playing videogames such as Raft, Minecraft or Animal Crossing
